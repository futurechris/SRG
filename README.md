# SRG
Meteor-based refresh of [SpaceRobotGames.com](http://SpaceRobotGames.com) with some new functionality.

## What it is
The raison d'Ãªtre for this rewrite is to implement an externally facing representation of the SRG project "pipeline" concept. In short, rather than focus on building, marketing, and shipping a single project at a time, the SRG experiment is to allow projects more time to soak. Inspiration is fickle - perhaps patience will yield better games.

To that end, the following features are designed to communicate the status of each project to anyone who might be interested, and eventually to gather feedback about the projects as well.

Each "project" should have:
 - Progress timeline / backlog
 - Velocity estimates
 - Sales data (because the community needs more of this)
 - Blog
 - Screenshots / Video
 - (to be continued...)
 - Voting/user comments

Long-term, each project should also have:
 - Issue report integration
 - Forum
 - Player/user feedback tools (polling, etc.)
 - Feature "deep listings"

Additionally, the site will include a few other bits of general functionality:
 - A GitHub-style work log, because I love visualizations.
 - Various widgets to display recent work, the next-to-release project, which projects are most popular, etc.

## How to use
Instructions for how to utilize SRG for your own site/projects will be added later, once the project has matured enough to be valuable to someone else. :)

## Contributing
I welcome any sort of contribution, feedback, help, comments, thoughts, or what-have-you.
